<p class="Body">This addon supports configuring filtering on the output.</p>
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Enable setpoint hysteresis</h3>
<p class="Body">Enabling setpoint hysteresis changes the trigger point for the industrial controller based on the previous output state (activated or deactivated).  As an example, if you were controlling temperature, this would cause the industrial controller to work like a thermosat.  If you have a hysteresis of 2 degrees, the output will be active until your feedback signal is 2 degrees above the setpoint.  Once this condition is met, the output will be deactivated.  The output would remain deactivated until the feedback signal was 2 degrees below the setpoint, at which point, it will activate.  To enable setpoint hysteresis, select <strong>Enable Hysteresis</strong> and set <strong>Setpoint Hysteresis (EU)</strong> to the desired value.</p>
<h3>Enable output switching filter</h3>
<p>With most industrial actuators, you do not want to be switching on and off quickly.  A debounce filter can be enabled on the output to ensure a minimum time between output switching. To enable the output switching filter, select <strong>Enable Switching Filter</strong> and set <strong>Minimum Switching Duration (secs)</strong> to the desired value.</p>
<p>Note: This filter is applied after the hysteresis (if enabled).  Therefore, if you continue with the themperature control example above, you could set the minimum switching duration to be 60 seconds.  In this case, the feedback would have to be 2 degrees above the setpoint for 60 seconds before it deactivated.  Conversely, it would have to be 2 degrees below the setpoint for 60 seconds before it activated.</p>
<p>Note: The output switching filter is bipassed when using the Manual Control and Manual State channels.</p>
